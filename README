Net::DNS::Dynamic::Adfilter - A DNS ad filter

This is a Perl DNS server intended for use as an ad filter for a local area 
network. Its function is to load lists of ad domains and nullify DNS queries 
for those domains to the loopback address. Any other DNS queries are proxied 
upstream, either to a specified list of nameservers or to those listed in 
/etc/resolv.conf. The module can also load and resolve host definitions found 
in /etc/hosts as well as hosts defined in a sql database.

For dynamic listings, an externally maintained host list can be loaded periodically 
through a specified url. A local addendum of hosts may also be specified.

The module is under development and currently works only on OSX 10.5+ machines 
due to system calls to ''networksetup''. These calls modify dns settings on the 
wireless interface. 

See sample interface script scripts/adfilter.pl
