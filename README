Net::DNS::Dynamic::Adfilter - A DNS ad filter

This is a Perl DNS server intended for use as an ad filter for a local area 
network. Its function is to load lists of ad domains and nullify DNS queries 
for those domains to the loopback address. Any other DNS queries are proxied 
upstream, either to a specified list of nameservers or to those listed in 
/etc/resolv.conf. The module can also load and resolve host definitions found 
in /etc/hosts as well as hosts defined in a sql database.

See sample interface script scripts/adfilter.pl

Installation:
