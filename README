pod2text Net::DNS::Dynamic::Adfilter.pm > README

A pure Perl nameserver for the purpose of filtering advertising. Loads ad domains 
from pgl.yoyo.org/adservers/. This module is experimental and currently works only 
on OSX 10.5+ machines due to system calls to ''networksetup''.

Also see sample interface script scripts/adfilter.pl

Installation:

perl Makefile.PL
make
sudo make test
sudo make install

Use: sudo perl adfilter.pl -bg
