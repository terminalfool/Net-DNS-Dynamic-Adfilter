Net::DNS::Dynamic::Adfilter - A DNS ad filter

This is a Perl DNS server intended for use as an ad filter for a local area 
network. The module loads lists of ad domains and resolves DNS queries 
for those domains to the loopback address 127.0.0.1. The module forwards any 
other requests downstream to a specified list of nameservers or determines 
forwarding according to /etc/resolv.conf. The module can also load and resolve 
any /etc/hosts definitions that might exist. 

Ad domain definitions are loaded from pgl.yoyo.org/adservers and from an 
optional domain list on the local host.

The module is under development and currently works only on OSX 10.5+ machines 
due to system calls to ''networksetup''. These calls modify dns settings on the 
wireless interface.
